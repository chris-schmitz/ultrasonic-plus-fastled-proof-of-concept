# Ultrasonic sensor + LED strip proof of concept

![demo](./readme_attachments/demo.gif)

This is a quick proof of concept for tying the ultrasonic distance sensor output to the led brightness.

Nothing revolutionary here, just working through the code for it. That said, it is worth noting this poc has an example of implementing a rolling average to smooth out the readings for the ultrasonic sensor, so that will be a good reference for future projects.
